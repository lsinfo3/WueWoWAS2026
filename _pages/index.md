# WueWoWAS'26

The KuVS Fachgespräch - Würzburg Workshop on Next-Generation Networks with a special focus on 6G Networks, distributed computing, and related technologies (WueWoWAS’26) focuses on preliminary and ongoing research and previously published hot topic papers on next-generation networks (NGN).

The central theme is 6G networks and compute infrastructure, covering advanced architectures, technologies, and concepts that will enable the next generation of connectivity, intelligence, and automation across multiple domains

The workshop will take place in-person in Würzburg, Germany on 28.09.2026 - 30.09.2026. We encourage PhD students, early career scientists, as well as senior researchers to contribute early-state and ongoing research or previously published hot topic papers in the form of extended abstracts no longer than 3 pages, with 1 additional page for references.

The goal of the workshop is to foster communication among researchers from industry and academia and provide a venue for early feedback. To this end, invited experience talks and discussion slots on important topics in NGN, 6G, and related computing aspects are an integral part of the program.

More details will be published soon.
